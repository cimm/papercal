# SynoPaperCal

SynoPaperCal is an application for [paperd.ink](https://paperd.ink/) devices. It connects to a [Synology Calendar](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/calendar) and displays todayâ€™s events. SynoPaperCal is still being developed, it kind of works for me but is not production ready software yet.
